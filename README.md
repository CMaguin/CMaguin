ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m CÃ©cile, PhD in physics.
During my thesis, I worked on MRI in brain imaging and on the novel CEST technique and modeling. You can find some of my codes from back then on the "CEST_modeling_toolbox" repository.

Right now as a hobby I'm working on simple algorithm for air pollution modeling (in private repo for now). I'll make them public once I'm satisfied enough with it! :)
