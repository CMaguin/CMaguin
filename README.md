Hi, I’m Cécile, PhD in physics, and specializing in data science. 
Right now, I work on modeling urban traffic emissions of pollutants at high resolution accross Europe. 
Also homebrewing a personal project on city pollution simulation as a side hobby :)

During my thesis, I worked on MRI in brain imaging and on the novel CEST technique and modeling. You can find some of my codes from back then on the "CEST_modeling_toolbox" repository.
